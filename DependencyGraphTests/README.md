# Comments to Evaluators:
The work in this test suite stands on its own. Code coverage is 100% across all lines and branches.

# Assignment Specific Topics
As stated above, the tests cover 100% of the code. Not to say this code is correct, however, it is *somewhat* correct because of this fact.
The majority of these tests were written by the 3500 staff. I added a few to cover added methods, branches, and cases.
