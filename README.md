# Time Expenditures:

    1. Assignment One:   Predicted Hours:          10        Actual Hours:     11       Notes: Found an error on Friday night and spent extra time fixing bugs.
    2. Assignment Two:   Predicted Hours:          10        Actual Hours:     6         Notes: Analysis took a lot of understanding the tests. After that, however, things were fairly simple.
