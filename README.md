# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality
Spreadsheet project current capabilities:
- Evaluating formulas
- Dependency graphs
- Circular Dependency handling
- Cell creation
- Filling cells (contents and values)
- Invalid formulas and variable names are handled to display in the cell
Future extensions are:  
- GUI/UX/UIX

# TODOS
Improvements:
- Formula validator is very messy...could use a refresh

# Examples of Good Software Practice (GSP)
- #### Separation of concerns
  I feel like I not only break methods up into smaller pieces, but I'm actively trying to understand the outline of this assignment.
It's cool to be able to watch the development of a useful app bit by bit.
- #### D.R.Y.
  This one could use some improvement, but I've always been focused on where I can create helper methods for repeated processes.
Throughout the Formula and DependencyGraph classes I use quite a few helper methods to break processes up and ensure I don't repeat
myself.
- #### Documentation
  I enjoy the documentation side of coding. It not only shows me that I understand the problem, but it helps me internalize what's
being done with my code even further.
- #### Object-Oriented Principles
  I try to think about how different objects should be separated (much like separation of concerns), but from a perspective
of what makes sense for certain classes. I'm often thinking about the longevity of the project.
# Time Expenditures:

    1. Assignment One:   Predicted Hours:          10        Actual Hours:     11       Notes: Found an error on Friday night and spent extra time fixing bugs.
    2. Assignment Two:   Predicted Hours:          10        Actual Hours:     6        Notes: Analysis took a lot of understanding the tests. After that, however, things were fairly simple.
    3. Assignment Three: Predicted Hours:          12        Actual Hours:     12       Notes: Took me a few days to really understand the assignment. I was nervous to copy and paste.
    4. Assignment Four:   Predicted Hours:          8        Actual Hours:     10       Notes: Again, the testing and analysis phases were a little more strenuous as a tried to understand the problem.
    4. Assignment Five:   Predicted Hours:          9        Actual Hours:      9        Notes: Had some bugs at the end, but got things  sorted
