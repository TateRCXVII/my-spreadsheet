# Time Expenditures:

    1. Assignment One:   Predicted Hours:          10        Actual Hours:     11       Notes: Found an error on Friday night and spent extra time fixing bugs.
    2. Assignment Two:   Predicted Hours:          10        Actual Hours:     6        Notes: Analysis took a lot of understanding the tests. After that, however, things were fairly simple.
    3. Assignment Three: Predicted Hours:          12        Actual Hours:     12       Notes: Took me a few days to really understand the assignment. I was nervous to copy and paste.
    4. Assignment Four:   Predicted Hours:          8        Actual Hours:     10       Notes: Again, the testing and analysis phases were a little more strenuous as a tried to understand the problem.
