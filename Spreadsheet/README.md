# Time Estimate vs. Actual Breakdown
|        | Expected | Actual | Notes                                                                                                                    |
|--------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Analysis| 2        | 3    | I was pretty close with my initial analysis of the problem. I did have to go back a few times and reread, which took me a little while.|
|Testing | 3        | 3      | I worked hard on testing first! Helped me understand the problem more. |
|Implementation | 1        | 2      | My initial thought that this would be a little more simple than it was. Fixing edge cases dragged the process out.                                           |
|Debug   | 2        | 3      | I had a frustrating night trying to figure out all the regex stuff... that was a big chunk of time.             |
| Total: | 8       | 11      |   |

# Assignment Specific Topics
This assignment helped me internalize the benefits of starting with good code and using DRY principles. Having the ability to
use methods and functionality we implemented in the past was really cool! Gave me a good perspective on everything.
### Cell Class
This project also includes a cell class which represents a cell in the Spreadsheet. The cell can contain a formula, text, or value
at this stage of the Spreadsheet.
