# Comments to Evaluators:
The work in this assignment stands on its own. It was created without any outside influence that hasn't been cited below.

# Time Estimate vs. Actual Breakdown
|        | Expected | Actual | Notes                                                                                                                    |
|--------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|        | 3        | 2      | Once I grasped the task and data structure, analysis was fairly simple.                                              |
|        | 2        | 1      | Because I understood the task, implementing the graph was also simple and used mainly default methods.                |
|        | 2        | 2      | Adding tests is a key component to having correct code.                                                                  |
|        | 3        | 1      | As I added tests, more bugs were apparent, but didn't do as much debugging as I expected off the bat.                 |
| Total: | 10       | 6      | Overall, took less time than I had estimated, which allowed me to think of more tests and improve my Evaluator class. |

# Assignment Specific Topics
I think there's a better way to check the Dependees and Dependents dictionaries for existing keys than what I'm currently doing. 
Definitely room for future improvement on this matter.
