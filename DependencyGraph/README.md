# Comments to Evaluators:
The work in this assignment stands on its own. There are many instances where exceptions are handled possibly redundantly. I chose this
tactic in order to provide the user and myself with more case-by-case error codes. However, this could be a possible improvement in the future

# Time Estimate Breakdown
- 3 hrs analyzing and understanding the problem
- 2 hrs of production and development
- 2 hrs of test creation (before and after production)
- 3 hrs of debugging and improvement

- 10 hrs total

# Assignment Specific Topics
With the algorithm being provided, walking through the coding analysis and implementation phase was fairly simple. The tough part was
figuring out what to test for and how. There were a few exceptions provided in the assignment description, however for the most part it was
up to us to understand the algorithm and what would be valid and what would not.

This Class makes use of extensions for the Stack to help with overall efficiency and readability. In the future, I can definitely add more 
extensions to increase my code readability. I need to take more time to plan out my code.

I learned a lot about C#, delegates, exception handling, and overall algorithm design from this assignment.
